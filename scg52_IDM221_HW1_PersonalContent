#Stephen Gross

I'm Steve. That being said I'm a nineteen year old student at Drexel University. My personal hobbies include gaming, Boy Scouts, and theater. Aside from hobbies I am a huge dog person. In total my family has four dogs. My sisters own two but they visit a lot. The first time I was employed for an extensive period was as a dog watcher. I think the most dogs I've had to watch at one time was around seven. Currently my favorite movies are in the Marvel Cinematic area. Right now I find inspiration in the works of H.P. Lovecraft. He created the unimaginable and blazed a path for weird creatures and fantastical stories. 

Gaming is one of my few passions. Currently my favorite game is a MOBA called Paragon. Presonally I love the genre of MOBAs because of the vast amount of things you can do with that kind of game. League of Legends currently has over one hundred and thirty different characters to make each match very different in how you play and team strategy. In my spare time I have made a board game and am currently working on another. The first one is called Eight Warriors and supports up to eight players fighting for control of kingdom without a king. The latest project is called The Daily Tarot Mystic Show (DTMS) where a traveling psychic visits a calm surburban town and trouble begins to brew. DTMS is loosely based on the game Betrayal at the House on the Hill; it has many scenarios which provide for countless nights of varied gameplay. I also worked on two video game projects. The first was The Adventure of ^Almost Sir Riley where a frivolous Dog-Knight must rid his town of a gang of evil Gnomes. The second game is called Fridgelight. Fridgelight is a comedy horror game where the player must traverse a randomly generated maze whilst being chased by giant food monsters, namely Hotdogs, and Gummybears. I served as project manager for both games and creative lead.

I am also an avid thespian. Last year I had a role in Drexel Coop Theater's From Beneath It Lurks. I often talk about this show because it really shifted my focus on theater. The way From Beneath was set up was by the actors. We created characters and scenes and our brilliant playwrite Carl we came up with a script. I learned so much while working on that show that honestly I want to focus more on improvisational theater in the future. Though I love improv now I still had roots doing shows 'by the book.' Senior year I got every highschool actor's dream to play the lead role. I played King Arthur in Monty Python's Spamalot. As a huge Monty Python nerd I was exstatic to learn that that was our senior show. I can still quote most of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which Spamalot was based off of. Other parts that I loved were the Genie in Aladdin jr, Willard in Footloose, and J.B. Biggley in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. I even worked at a theater camp that I used to attend when I was younger. There I mainly worked as a counselor but a few times I was asked to teach the Drama or Improv classes held in the morning.

Scouting is a huge part of my life. I started at the , almost, bottom and worked my way up to Eagle Scout. Its true I started in Wolf when I entered Cub Scouts but I was only a year late. Traditionally scouting starts with Tiger Scout. Working my way htrough cubs I earned my arrow of light, the highest honor of cubs abd the only patch that carries over to the boy scout uniform. While in Boy Scout troop 44 I served several times as patrol leader, then Quartermaster, and finally Assistant Senior Patrol Leader (ASPL) and Senior Patrol Leader (SPL). ASPL and SPL are like vice president and president respectively. My Eagle project was a blast. It took me a while to get rolling but I found a project that a local wildlife refuge needed help with. Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge needed a playscape for when they have schools visit. I happily said I would tackle the challenge. In the end they recieved four nature based play equipment. The largest one was either the rock tunnel or the wigwam. A wigwam, for those who may not know, was a small house that nomadic Native Americans would build and use in the pine barrens of New Jersey. The volunteers and I had to sew around forty cattail mats to cover the wigwam from the elements. The rock tunnel however required moving large stones around an industrial strength pipe so kids can climb and crawl through it. The rest of the project included a balance beam made out of a fallen log and log steppers.
