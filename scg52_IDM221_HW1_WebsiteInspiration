#Netflix

I like Netflix because of the ease of flow. They obviously pay people a lot to focus on how to get their users to never leave. The layout of content is really helpful when looking for new shows or movies that relate to what the user wants to watch. When I use their site I often sit around and browse for a while, not even watching anything. I just want to see if I can find anything interesting. My problem is I am able to find too much. The layout is very visually appealing and draws me in.

#Steam

I enjoy steam for its immense library of content. Steam has tons of content, not solely limited to games. With that they are able to sort and present games and other items that they believe the user will enjoy. As with Netflix they have worked long and hard on how to present their catalog. Though I must admit it tends to follow the same flow as most other sites when it comes to finding and presenting content. 

#Facebook

Facebook allows me to constantly have a place to share with people. Namely people I know very well. I could say again that I like the layout but that is a bit dry now. The reason I put Facebook on this list is because it is probably the biggest social media site on the market. It allows me to follow things of interest to me as well as see how my friends and family are doing. It creates this huge database of memories to sift through and engulf the time you should be spending doing work.
