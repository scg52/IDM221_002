        <p>Something weird approaches. One day a small stagecoach appears in your lovely town, then come the monsters. Daily Tarot Mystic Show is a board game about interpretation, interpretation by the mystic. One player plays the Mystic, essentially a game master. Once a round of turns has been complete then everyone gets their fortune read. The fun thing is is that the cards do not say what they do, the Mystic has to interpret them. Eventually the twon is faced with a crisis and the people must band together to stop it. </p>
