        <p>Eight warriors is a game where up to eight players each command a powerful soldier to fight. The last soldier standing wins. The trick is that you cannot see the stats of the other soldiers. That way nobody knows who has the most powerful hero on the board. Events trigger throughout the game so that the players can collect valuable items to help them beat their opponents.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>The game starts out with players randomly choosing the stat card and ultimate card for their hero. The stat card dictates how much health, attack power, speed, and mana a hero has. The ultimate card gives the hero a special ability that they can only use a certain amount of times. Once used the first time the player must reveal their ultimate card. Once those cards are chosen then the players get to choose two magic ability cards. These should compliment the strengths and weaknesses of the stats your hero has. Once all players are ready place your hero tokens on the board. There are a total of eight gates for players to start on. The players then take turns traversing the board and battling each other. Every time a hero dies that triggers an event. Events spwan a random item card on one of the eight shrines located around the board. Items are powerful and are very hotly contested. The last hero standing is the winner.</p>
