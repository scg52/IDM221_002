        <p>This was the first big project I ever worked on. I worked on this project at a summer program at Drexel called the Drexel University Computing Academy, or DUCA. My group called ourselves The Storyteller's Guild. The guild consisted of myself as Project Manager, Caeleb Nasof as Coder, Jake Carfagno as Artist, Adrian Rosenbrook as Animator, Kevin Reimensperger on Sound Design, and Javier Figuroa on Quality Assurance. I was elected PM due to the concept of the game being mine. Sir Riley is a character I have had for many years. This game was supposed to be a prequel to the many short stories I have written of Sir Riley. This game was a one level prototype of a full game to get us used to professional workflow and project developement. This is a whimsical 2D platformer for any age.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>The Adventure of <i>Almost</i> Sir Riley is a 2D platformer. The player controls Sir Riley and must clear out the village of gnomes that have invaded. There are two types of Gnomes. Basic Battle Gnomes just run at the player and deal damage if touched. Bazooka Gnomes are a little more challenging since they fire small Gnoming missiles at the player. To defeat them you have to wait until they just fired then run and kill them. Once the player has cleared out all the little gnomes then the boss spawns in. The boss is Gertrude the Goblin Gnome. Gertrude is a massive Goblin Gnome hybrid that slams her fists into the ground. Once she slams the ground her arms get stuck and there is an opening for the player to hit Gertrude. Riley's main weapon is his trusty Ukulele of Ultimate Destruction. Fight your way through the horde of gnomes to victory.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>This is the pre-quel to all of my short stories on Sir Riley. He is a brave dog knight who takes on wacky challenges and fights his sworn enemy, the evil sorceror Mr. Chips. To begin the story Mr. Chips breaks out of the magical prison which held him for minor convictions. Thus he brought an army of evil gnomes to invade the land. Now a peasant Riley stands up to the gnomes threatening his village using his trusty Ukulele as a weapon. He joins with a scholar from the town named Magnus and the two set off to free the land. They travel to the local Noble to seek help. The duo are sent to the swamp of Squal-ash to defeat the great worm Wrost and return it to the great Noble. Upon returning Riley and Magnus find out it was all a ruse and the Noble was working with Mr Chips. They then have to defeat the Noble and in doing so find out how to get into the king's castle. With this new revelation Riley traverses the land to the castle to defeat Mr Chips. The fighting is long and partway through the battle some of Mr Chips' destructive force is channeled into Riley's Ukulele. It becomes the Ukulele of Ultimate Destruction. With this new power Riley defeats the evil sorceror for his first of many duels. Mr Chips promptly flees and Riley is officially knighted by King Lucky.</p>
