        <p>Something weird approaches. One day a small stagecoach appears in your lovely town, then come the monsters. The Daily Tarot Mystic Show (DTMS) is a board game about interpretation, interpretation by the mystic. One player plays the Mystic, essentially a game master. Once a round of turns has been complete then everyone gets their fortune read. The fun thing is is that the cards do not say what they do, the Mystic has to interpret them. Eventually the town is faced with a crisis and the people must band together to stop it. 3-6 players.</p>

        <p>Everybody starts as usual by choosing their character. Different characters have different abilities which make them unique. One player must be designated as the Mystic for the game. Once all the setup is complete the players each start in their house. After a certain amount of turns the terrors start to invade the town. There are multiple types of ways the game can unfold. The Mystic is in control of what terrors or conflict arises in the town. The players must collect items and defeat whatever the Mystic throws their way.</p>

        <p>The Mystic has the most important role in the game. They run the game. After each round, that is after every player has had their turn, the Mystic passes out one tarot card to each player. They them interpret the cards and the players either reap the reward or fall behind. After a certain amount of rounds something strange starts to happen in the town. The mystic chooses the catastrophy which starts encroaching upon the town. It is the players' duty to figure out what terror is trying to enter their town. Once they figure out which mystery is materializing the players must either work together to vanquish it or work against each other in order to win. The Mystic is in control of any monsters or terrors that are invading. </p>
